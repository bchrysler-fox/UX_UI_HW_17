    <p>I am Brian Chrysler. I was born in Southern California, grew up in Los Angeles, and graduated from the University of Southern California with a degree in archaeology. I have worked in technology since 2016, mostly in technical support. My skills are a combination of awareness of the culture and approach that indivuduals take and a voracious appetite to do more good in the world. I love to travel, and recently I have taken to traveling up to Canada frequently to visit my boyfriend, cook for him, and assist him with his animals. Consider me for your UX/UI needs!</p>
